# Apartment-heating
In this project, we will employ differential equations and advanced numerical methods to showcase the heat propagation process within our home through animations. As part of the experiment, we will have the ability to alter the positioning of radiators and adjust their maximum temperatures. Our primary objective is to discover optimal radiator settings, striking the perfect balance between our comfort and energy savings.

All computations and analyses have been programmed in Python, enabling precise modeling and simulations. Additionally, we've crafted several animations (located in the 'animations' folder) that allow us to track how heat spreads within our home space minute by minute.
